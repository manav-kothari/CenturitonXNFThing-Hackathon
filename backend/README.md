# Royalty NFTs

## Coded with:

- Solidity
- Javascript (Web3.js, Truffle)

An example project I made of an NFT Projects smart contracts that pay royalties to the original artist whenever any of the NFT is exchanged (sold) between wallets. These royalties are at the level of the smart contract of the NFT itself, rather than at the level of the marketplace, which is preferable. The smart contracts for this project are coded in Solidity. The deployment, tests, and realtime example of a transfer are coded in Javascript, connecting to the blockchain using Web3.js, and the framework Truffle.
